# Cache Syntax Error Fix

## Issue Description

The application was failing to deploy due to syntax errors in `lib/cache/in-memory-cache.ts`. The specific errors were:

1. Invalid backslash characters (`\`) appearing before semicolons
2. Backslash characters appearing before closing braces
3. Standalone backslash characters on lines

These syntax errors prevented the TypeScript compiler from successfully building the application.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause appears to be one of the following:

1. **Copy-Paste Error**: Code may have been copied from a source that used escape characters
2. **Editor Configuration**: A text editor may have introduced these characters during editing
3. **Line Continuation**: Attempted use of backslashes as line continuation characters (which JavaScript doesn't support)

## Fix Implementation

The fix involved:

1. Completely removing the problematic file
2. Creating a new implementation with proper syntax
3. Ensuring all export functions have correct syntax without backslashes
4. Verifying the implementation works with existing code

## Verification

The fixed implementation:

1. Maintains the same API as the original
2. Passes all verification tests
3. Integrates correctly with dependent components
4. Contains no syntax errors that would prevent compilation

## Security Considerations

The implementation:

1. Maintains proper error handling
2. Logs errors appropriately
3. Doesn't introduce any new security vulnerabilities
4. Maintains type safety with TypeScript generics

## Additional Diagnostic Steps

If deployment issues persist:

1. Check for cached files in the build system
2. Verify all import statements are correct
3. Run a local build to identify any remaining issues
4. Check for conflicting dependencies in package.json

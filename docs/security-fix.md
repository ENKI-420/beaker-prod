# Security Fix: Removed Exposed Environment Variable

## Issue
The sensitive environment variable `ADMIN_TOKEN` was exposed in client-side code in `components/admin/init-rbac.tsx`. This posed a security risk as the admin token could be viewed by anyone inspecting the page source.

## Solution
1. Created a server action (`app/actions/admin-actions.ts`) to handle RBAC initialization securely
2. Updated the client component to use a form with password input for token entry
3. Moved all token validation to the server side
4. Removed direct references to the environment variable from client code

## Security Improvements
- The admin token is now only validated on the server
- Users must manually enter the token when performing admin operations
- The token is never included in client-side JavaScript
- Form submission uses a secure server action

## Best Practices Implemented
- Separation of client and server code
- Server-side validation of sensitive credentials
- Use of password input for token entry
- Clearing sensitive data after use

## Recommended Environment Variable Change
Consider using a server-side only environment variable for admin tokens since it's no longer needed on the client side.

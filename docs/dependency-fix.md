# React Dependency Conflict Resolution

## Issue

During deployment, we encountered a dependency conflict between React 19.1.0 and react-day-picker 8.10.1:

\`\`\`
npm error Found: react@19.1.0
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react@"^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from react-day-picker@8.10.1
\`\`\`

## Resolution

We downgraded React from version 19 to version 18.2.0 to maintain compatibility with all dependencies, including react-day-picker.

### Changes Made:

1. Updated package.json to specify React 18.2.0:
   \`\`\`json
   "react": "^18.2.0",
   "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
   \`\`\`

2. This change ensures compatibility with all existing dependencies while maintaining a stable production build.

## Future Considerations

1. Monitor for updates to react-day-picker that support React 19
2. Consider alternative date picker libraries if needed
3. Test thoroughly after any dependency updates

## Impact

This change should have no functional impact on the application, as React 18 provides all the necessary features for our current implementation.
